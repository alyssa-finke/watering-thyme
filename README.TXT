I'm using this project as a fun and effective way to learn React. I've been using a udemy course as my initial guide, 
but also making changes and have planned additions to make the project my own.

The app will be used to track my plants and the frequency in which they need to be watered, providing an alert when it is 
watering day--which is something I (or really, my plants) very much need. Thus, it is aptly named 'Thyme' (punny, right?)
